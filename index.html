      <p>This site will shortly serve as my portfolio, but is currently a heavy work-in-progress. Meanwhile, I have
          included a brief description of my CSC512 final project and a link to its source code on gitHub.</p>

      <h3 class="w3-text-team" style="text-align:center;">CSC 512 Project</h3>
      <p>The Traveling Salesman Problem is a well-known problem in combinatorial optimization. Given a complete
          graph, the solution takes the form of the shortest path that will visit each
          node exactly one time, returning to the first node at the final step. /br /br
          This project's goal was initially to compare several leading algorithms that
          approximate the optimal solution, including one modeling the tour as a quantum
          system. This project is still in progress, but several heuristics have been
          completed (if not completely optimized), including several construction heuristics,
          a simulated annealing heuristic, and an adaptation of the Lin-Kernighan algorithm.
